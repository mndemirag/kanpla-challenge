## The Story

Once upon a time, in the bustling town of Flavorville, there was a local kitchen famous for its delicious food. However, the town's families were very poor, each with a different number of family members.

Each family needed a different number of portions to feed their members and had a different, tight budget, setting a maximum price per portion they could pay. To help them, the kitchen decided to offer food in bundles at more favorable prices if the families could pool their orders together.

Your task is to help the kitchen by writing a function that takes the requested portions and the maximum prices the families can pay, along with the different bundles the kitchen offers, and figure out which orders will get fulfilled to keep the families of Flavorville happy and well-fed.

## Your Task
Complete the `allocatePortions` function, which helps families to share bundles so that as many people can afford the be fed.
- Users:
  - Specify the number of portions needed.
  - Specify the maximum price they are willing to pay per portion.
- Bundles:
  - Each bundle contains a certain number of orders.
  - Each bundle has a total price.
- Constraints:
  - Users can only receive orders from bundles that do not exceed their maximum price per order.
 
## Deliverables
- Access to your repository / or a zip file via mail
- 5-minute video presentation using Loom or a similar. Present the logic behind your solution and walk us through your code as if sharing with other developers for a quick review. Aim to help us understand how your solution works and the logic behind your approach.

## Bonus Question
Describe a potential improvement or alternative algorithm for the `getCheapestCombination` function that could potentially yield more favorable pricing.
